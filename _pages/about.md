I completed my undergraduate studies in Financial Mathematics at the University of Leeds. Driven by my strong in strong interest in statistics and programming, I went to University of Cambridge to finish an MPhil in Data Intensive Science. Currently, I am a Research Assistant in [Brian Lim's](https://www.brianlim.net/) Lab, where my research focuses on explainable AI, human-computer interaction (HCI), and AI applications in healthcare. I am actively working on a project related to explainable facial recognition with [Wencan](https://wencanz.github.io/).

For more details about my experience, please refer to my CV and portfolio.
