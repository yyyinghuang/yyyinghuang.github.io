I completed my undergraduate studies in Financial Mathematics at the University of Leeds, followed by an MPhil in Data Intensive Science at the University of Cambridge, driven by my strong interest in statistics and computing. Currently, I am a Research Assistant in [Brian Lim's](https://www.brianlim.net/) Lab, where my research focuses on explainable AI, human-computer interaction (HCI), and AI applications in healthcare. I am actively working on a project related to explainable facial recognition.

For more details about my experience, please refer to my CV and portfolio.
