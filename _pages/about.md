I am a first-year PhD student at the National University of Singapore, working with [Prof. Brian Lim](https://www.brianlim.net/) My research lies in:

* Human–Computer Interaction (HCI):
  I am interested in bringing human perspectives into AI systems. My work is inspired by psychology and cognitive science, and focuses on how people actually perceive, reason about, and interact with intelligent systems. I hope to make space for the human voice in computer science and help bridge understanding between people and intelligent systems.

* Explainable AI (XAI):
  Rather than chasing state-of-the-art performance, I care more about understanding why models behave the way they do, and how this understanding can support human interpretation and use.
